### Vectors

In tensor notation, a **vector** is written as

$$
\mathbf{u} = u_i
$$

where $i = 1,2,3$, corresponding to the $x$, $y$, and $z$ component, respectively.


$$
\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v} = u_i + v_i
$$

### Einstein summation

Any index appearing twice is automatically summed from 1 to 3.
This is called Einstein summation. Any index can at most appear twice. 

### Dot (inner) product

Using Einstein summation, the dot (inner) product of two vectors is

$$
\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v} = u_i v_i = u_1 v_1 + u_2 v_2 + u_3 v_3
$$

### Dyadic (outer) product

The dyadic (outer) product of two vectors is

$$
\mathbf{u} \otimes \mathbf{v} = u_i v_j = 
\left[
\begin{matrix} 
u_1 v_1 & u_1 v_2 & u_1 v_3 \cr
u_2 v_1 & u_2 v_2 & u_2 v_3 \cr
u_3 v_1 & u_3 v_2 & u_3 v_3 
\end{matrix}
\right]
$$

### Differentiation with respect to time

Differentiation with respect to time can be written as 

$$
\frac{\text{d}\mathbf{x}}{\text{d}t} = \mathbf{\dot{x}} = \dot{x_i} = x_{i|t}
$$


### Differentiation with respect to space

The gradient of a scalar function is given by

$$
\nabla \phi = \partial_i \phi = \phi_{|i}
$$

The component-wise spatial derivative of a vector

$$
\frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial x_j} = u_{i|j}
$$

The divergence of a vector is

$$
\text{div} \ \mathbf{u} = \nabla \cdot \mathbf{u} = u_{i|i}
$$

### Kronecker delta

The Kronecker delta is defined as

$$
\delta_{ij} = \begin{cases}
\begin{matrix}
1 & i = j \cr
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{matrix}
\end{cases}
$$

Kronecker delta is also often called the substitution operator, as

$$
u_i \delta_{ij} = u_j
$$

The Kronecker delta often occurs when one deals with spatial derivatives of position

$$
\frac{\partial x_i}{\partial x_j} = \partial_j x_i = x_{i|j} = \delta_{ij}
$$


### Levi-Civita alternating tensor

$$
\epsilon_{ijk} = \begin{cases}
\begin{matrix}
1 & ijk \in \{123, 231, 312\} \cr
-1 & ijk \in \{132, 213, 321\} \cr
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{matrix}
\end{cases}
$$


Sometimes the following equality can be useful to simplify expressions:

$$
\epsilon_{ijk} \epsilon_{imn} = \delta_{jm}\delta_{kn}-\delta_{jn}\delta_{km}
$$

### Rotation or curl of a vector

$$
\text{rot} \ \mathbf{u} = \nabla \times \mathbf{u} = \epsilon_{ijk} u_{k|j}
$$
